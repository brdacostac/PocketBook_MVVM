{"subtitle": "Xerox PARC and the dawn of the computer age", "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "In the bestselling tradition of The Soul of a New Machine, Dealers of Lightning is a fascinating journey of intellectual creation. In the 1970s and '80s, Xerox Corporation brought together a brain-trust of engineering geniuses, a group of computer eccentrics dubbed PARC. This brilliant group created several monumental innovations that triggered a technological revolution, including the first personal computer, the laser printer, and the graphical interface (one of the main precursors of the Internet), only to see these breakthroughs rejected by the corporation. Yet, instead of giving up, these determined inventors turned their ideas into empires that radically altered contemporary life and changed the world.Based on extensive interviews with the scientists, engineers, administrators, and executives who lived the story, this riveting chronicle details PARC's humble beginnings through its triumph as a hothouse for ideas, and shows why Xerox was never able to grasp, and ultimately exploit, the cutting-edge innovations PARC delivered. Dealers of Lightning offers an unprecedented look at the ideas, the inventions, and the individuals that propelled Xerox PARC to the frontier of technohistory--and the corporate machinations that almost prevented it from achieving greatness."}, "title": "Dealers of Lightning", "lc_classifications": ["QA76.27 .H55 1999"], "covers": [684348], "first_sentence": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "The photograph shows a handsome man in a checked sport shirt, his boyish face half-obscured by a cloud of pipe smoke."}, "subject_places": ["California", "Palo Alto"], "first_publish_date": "1999", "key": "/works/OL1987733W", "authors": [{"type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}, "author": {"key": "/authors/OL239209A"}}], "dewey_number": ["004/.0720794/73"], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "subjects": ["History", "Research", "Xerox Corporation.
